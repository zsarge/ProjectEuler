# Prompt:

# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Steps:
# 1) Generate the products of all n digit numbers
# 2) Filter those that are palendromic
# 3) Find the largest result
