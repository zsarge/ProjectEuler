# [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

These are my solutions for various [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

Project Euler is a website that has hundreds of challenges related to writing algorithms to solve problems.

I use Project Euler mainly for programming challenges, but it also is nice for practicing mathematical reasoning.

I hope these solutions may be instructive to those who are interested.

  I did consider reference style links, and they didn't seem much better.
  Just try and view the formatted table, if you can.

[[View solutions filtered by language used]](solutionsByLanguages.md)

<br>
I have some scripts set up to make working on problems a smoother experience:

 - [`addSolution.rb`](addSolution.rb) takes a problem number, creates the associated folder and file, and copies the problem's prompt from the website.
 - [`generateReadme.rb`](generateReadme.rb) generates this readme based on the files in the solutions folder.

Every solution gets its own directory because I plan on varying the languages I use, and this keeps everything uniform.
